Summary: 

The State of Tennessee Department of General Services is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for the procurement of operation and maintenance services for a water and wastewater facility in West Tennessee. This RFI comes after the cancellation of a previous Request for Proposals (RFP) due to the State's inability to agree on terms with potential awardees.

The respondent will be responsible for staffing, training, maintenance, and regulatory compliance. The agreement between the Authority and the respondent will be for a duration of ten years, with the possibility of annual price adjustments based on legal or regulatory changes. The respondent will also be responsible for biosolids management and disposal. Interested parties are requested to fill out a technical informational form and a cost informational form, as well as provide feedback on a draft RFP and Pro Forma Contract.
